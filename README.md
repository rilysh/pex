## pex
A little program to list your x86 CPU features

## Info
Due to many more limitations with AMD CPUs, several feature lists *might* not work there. There's an excellent Wikipedia page about it, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Differences_between_AMD64_and_Intel_64)

Tested under i3 (3rd gen, Ivy Bridge)
